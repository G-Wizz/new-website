          <p>During my time as a remote service technician I became addicted to web development. Due to my working conditions, etc I was unable to attend a full-time or even part-time college to begin my journey as a web developer. I started teaching myself to code with the help of friends and mentors. I also attended several online schools. I felt like they were lacking something. A mentor of mine suggested a few online courses and I have been taking them since, along with a few supplemental courses.</br></br>
  
            At the beginning my focus was on Ruby. Ruby is a fairly easy language to understand and was suitable for a beginner programmer to learn the basics of coding. Later on I realized that Ruby alone was simply not enough. During one of the online code bootcamps I was attending I was learning Javascript. After the course was completed I realized that I knew nothing about Javascript. This is where the self study began.</br></br>
            
            I have always been a creative person that looks at things from a different angle.</br></br>
            
            I have a constant need to feed my brain more knowledge.</br></br>
            
            I have been a musician since I was 11 years old.</br></br>
            
            1 week after I graduated high school I went to culinary school to fulfill my passion to become a professional chef. I was able to use my own creativity to cook wonderful food and inspire others that I have worked with in many kitchens throughout all of those years….but….something was missing. Even after working in the IT field for many years after that I felt the lack of ability to create….</br></br>
            
            …That is where my coding journey began</p>
